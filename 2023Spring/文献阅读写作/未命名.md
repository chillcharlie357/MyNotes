# Ray and Rlib

Ray and RLlib are both developed by the same team at UC Berkeley's RISELab and are designed to work together to provide a complete solution for reinforcement learning (RL) applications. However, they serve different purposes and have different functionalities.

1. Ray:
   - Ray is a general-purpose cluster computing framework that provides a unified API for building and running distributed applications.
   - Ray provides a flexible programming model that supports both task-parallel and actor-based computations.
   - Ray is designed to support a wide range of workloads, including simulation, training, and serving for RL applications, as well as other distributed applications.
   - Ray provides features such as fault tolerance, dynamic resource allocation, and distributed data storage.

2. RLlib:
   - RLlib is a reinforcement learning library built on top of Ray that provides a high-level API for building and training RL models.
   - RLlib provides a set of pre-built RL algorithms, such as DQN, PPO, and A3C, that can be easily configured and trained on various environments.
   - RLlib supports distributed training of RL models using Ray, allowing for efficient scaling of training across multiple machines.
   - RLlib provides features such as automatic checkpointing, hyperparameter tuning, and visualization of training progress.

In summary, Ray is a general-purpose cluster computing framework that provides a unified API for building and running distributed applications, while RLlib is a reinforcement learning library built on top of Ray that provides a high-level API for building and training RL models. Ray provides the infrastructure and flexibility for building and running distributed applications, while RLlib provides the tools and algorithms for building and training RL models efficiently.
